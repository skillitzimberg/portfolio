## Known Bugs

Media Queries:

The page was written for 1280 x 800px screen (MacBook Pro). I attempted to refactor it with media queries to be as smooth as I could get it down to 480px wide.

I don't understand how the ranges work. I can't see it in my head yet.

I did add columns at above 1290px, but I'm not real happy with them.
