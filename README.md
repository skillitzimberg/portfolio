## Known Bugs

Media Queries:

The page was written for 1280 x 800px screen. I attempted to refactor it with media queries to be as smooth as I could get it down to 480px wide.

It still looks as I wanted it in 1280px wide, but the media queries are not good below 1130px wide (to be generous).

Between 1130px and 800px wide it is broken. Above and below that range it's OK-ish.
