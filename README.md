## Description
This is a portfolio/personal website. It includes a blogging app for my own use and my curriculum vitae.

## Setup/Installation Requirements
If you would like to use the project as a starting point for a project of your own, fork the repository from: [GitHub](https://github.com/skillitzimberg/portfolio), then clone it to your machine.

See [SETUP](SETUP.md) to make sure you have the software the project uses installed.

Reference [WEBPACK](WEBPACK.md) for details on how the project environment is built.

## Known Bugs

Media Queries:

The page was written for 1280 x 800px screen (MacBook Pro). I attempted to refactor it with media queries to be as smooth as I could get it down to 480px wide.

I don't understand how the ranges work. I can't see it in my head yet.

I did add columns at above 1290px, but I'm not real happy with them.
