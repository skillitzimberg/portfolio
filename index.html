          <h3>Code</h3>
          <p>The week before my Epicodus cohort started I tried my hand at JavaScript by making a calculator: <a href="https://github.com/skillitzimberg/codeBlog">Calculator</a>. Besides JS, the project uses HTML &amp CSS.</p>

          <p>It works in a simple fashion. I'm having trouble with a smarter display/input window. The cursor will put input anywhere in the expression, but the buttons only put it at the end of the expression.</p>

          <p>When I started getting into solving the display problem in the calculator, I refactored another project I'd started when I was going through the Epicodus curriculum on my own: <a href="https://github.com/skillitzimberg/cipher">Cipher</a>. Again, display issues. The intent was to learn about taking input, using Regular expressions to get rid of spaces, then sort the remaining charaters by their type: numbers, letter, other character. The script is working, but I broke the display because even though it worked, I wasn't happy with how cluttered the code was. Then my cohort started and I haven't gotten back into the project, figuring that I'll be able to fix it using the JS focus of the second week of Epicodus Intro.</p>

          <p>My sister, Jessica, is a baker . . . a world-class baker. She was the lead baker at Tabor Bread before moving back to Colorado to take care of mom. So she's a badass. In addition to taking care of mom and her husband Tom (72 &amp 80 years old respectively), she's baking out of their tiny electric oven and selling out when she goes to farmer's markets. She even taking pre-orders. Also in the Epicodus curriculum is a cupcake shop website project. I took that as a jumping off point to make a website for Jessica: <a href="https://github.com/skillitzimberg/bread">Bread</a>. I haven't told her about this prospect yet, because I need more practice and information, but I really hope to get this functional for her.</p>

          <h3>Background</h3>
          <p><em>Why did you make the decision to enroll in a coding bootcamp? What are you aiming to achieve by completing 27 weeks of technical training?</em></p>
          <p>I got a job out of college in which one of my responsibilities was maintaining the website. I had never encountered HTML and CSS before. I learned how to do it by using "view source," <strong>CSSZengarden</strong>, and dissecting the code in order to see how it worked. I literally printed many pages of html and made diagrams to learn it. I gained some fluency and eventually redesigned the website from scratch. But between working, playing music, and relationships I could never devote myself to it. In late 2014 I enrolled in courses at <strong>Portland Community College</strong> to pursue a career in IT. One of the courses I took was an introduction to programming that used JavaScript. I really liked it and seemed to have an aptitude for it. I could easily spend 8 to 10 hours straight working on it. It absorbed me. Unfortunately, my relationship dissolved (not because of coding) and I had to make changes that did not allow me the time for school. Due to lifelong physical challenges, I've finally gotten to a place where I cannot sustain physical labor anymore and I am not willing to just take on any dead-end desk job. I need to take the plunge, risk it all. I've got nothing to lose and everything to gain.</p>

          <p><em>Do you already have specific goals for yourself in mind? If not, can you think of any now?</em></p>

          <p>My goal is to become a freelance web/app developer. I have that as my five year goal, but will do whatever I can to make it happen sooner. But honestly, just making a living coding, even at the financial level I have been working in warehouses and factories would be a major success. Ideally I'd like to work for small to medium size companies and non-profits as I really appreciate that scale of organization. There's something particulary intriguing to me about that level. Probably because I've tended to work for that size company and like how everyone knows everyone, processes are more fluid, and work is an "all hands on deck" affair - everyone can or does do everything, there are no real specialists.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="column aboutMe" id="aboutMe">
          <h3>About Me</h3>
          <p>I'm as shy of words as I am of cameras. They are both unflattering and it's glaringly obvious how pained I am to seem at ease, cool, smart, or even just pretty alright. Instead you can see the crazy swirling around behind shifty eyes. At least that's what I see, so yeah, I keep away from the pointy side of the lens and a wagging tongue.</p>

          <p>And here I go starting a blog. Why? Because I'm finally taking action and choosing a path, a path I've considered before in less concrete ways, and could never get much traction in. I'm going to do my damnedest to become a professional web developer.</p>

          <p>The decision has been forced due to issues that make physical labor no longer sustainable for me. I'll be in pain for the rest of my life regardless of my profession, but there's no reason for me to aggravate the problem with the work I do. I need to save my physical efforts for healthy things like working out and training in martial arts - things that make me feel good despite the pain.</p>

          <p>So where am I on this path? To me it seems like maybe a mile in at this point. And honestly I've covered this mile a couple of times over the years, but never quite the same way and the field has changed a lot over the years I've watched it. I'm relearning HTML/CSS right now. I've had some experience with JavaScript and even less with Ruby before, but I'm concentrating on the fundamentals and trying to get that really fluid.</p>

          <p>I'm using the <a href="https://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/intro-to-programming-online"><strong>Epicodus curriculum</strong></a> and Colt Steele's "The Web Developer Bootcamp" course on <a href="https://www.udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp"><strong>Udemy</strong></a>. When I hit the resort website project I was kind of stumped by the creative side of the assignment. I know enough to be a danger to myself and a website full of barely styled lists and random photos scattered throughout just didn't appeal to me. I wanted to make something at least marginally slicker than that. The problem is that besides needing to refresh on the material I'd learned previously, I have a kind of creative block on web design. There are so many ways a site can be layed out! What do I choose? How does my choice affect how I structure the HTML? How do I write HTML that CSS can style any way I want without editing it to work for the new styles? And how do I choose colors that aren't drab or garish, that have some kind of relationship to the project itself? Where do I get all these photos without spending hours just copying and pasting urls and file names? Aaaagggghhh!</p>

          <p>OK. Calm down, kid. How to tackle this reasonably? Through Mr. Steele's bootcamp I knew that Bootstrap Grid was a thing and made lay out way way more simple than it was when I first encountered this stuff in 2000. Then I found out that CSS has a native grid (presumably this is what Bootstrap exploits and embellishes, but I don't know that for a fact yet). I decided to first learn layout by building a photo gallery project using nothing but the old CSS float methods; then I recreated the same thing using CSS grids; next I'll tackle Bootstrap grid. But I wound up getting antsy about the resort project, so I ended up building it using vanilla CSS. (Is that a thing? Sometimes it's better to speculate - why let Google ruin everything with "facts?") Anyway, here we are almost two weeks later and I've nearly got the basic resort website done. From there I can start branching and seeing what I can do to make variations with what I've learned so far.</p>

          <p>I feel a bit ashamed that it's taken me this long to get this far with the resort project, but I did make some deep detours, learned a ton, and made it relevant to the assignment at a level way above what the assignment was really looking for in terms of HTML/CSS. I've a got a better toolbox and a better understanding of how to use those tools. There is still a lot of refinement to be done, of course, but I've definitely done something.</p>

          <p>From what I've been reading about the process of becoming a web developer, I'm going to have to bare myself a bit and push the things I've done so far to Github, even though they're silly, simple, and nothing more than me futzing around trying to see how some things worked (or didn't). I guess I'll lay it all out there and see what happens. At least it's the truth and might give someone a laugh.</p>

        <div class="column" id="extracurricular">
          <h3>Extracurricular</h3>
          <p>I used to play music. From about 9 years old I taught myself guitar and eventually played in bands right up until 2017.</p>
          <p>Over the years I've played many instruments. I would rank my proficiency as:</p>

          <ol>
            <li>guitar</li>
            <li>mandola</li>
            <li>bass</li>
            <li>drums</li>
            <li>keys</li>
            <li>clarinet</li>
            <li>flute</li>
          </ol>

          <p>My last band was <span class="myemphasis">Damn Family</span>. In many ways this was the best band I've ever been in, but it's way different from the bands I'd been in before.</p>
          <p>I started training in martial arts, specifically <span class="myemphasis">Mo Duk Pai</span> in 2016 and it has replaced music. It holds most of my creative attention and keeps me fit. Also . . . who knew I liked being hit? Or that fighting was so much fun? In a way you kind of fall in love with your training and sparring partners. You get a very big sense of love for the world when you train hard and punch people, apparently.</p>
